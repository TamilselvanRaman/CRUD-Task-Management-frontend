# 📝 CRUD Task Management App (Frontend)

This is a **Task Management** frontend project built using **React.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It allows users to manage their tasks with full **CRUD functionality** – Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The app connects to a backend API (you can build with Node.js/Python) to store and manage tasks.

🔗 Backend API Integration
Make sure your backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) supports the following RESTful endpoints:

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/tasks	Fetch all tasks
POST	/api/tasks	Add a new task
PUT	/api/tasks/:id	Update task
DELETE	/api/tasks/:id	Delete task

You can use Axios or fetch() in React to call these APIs.
